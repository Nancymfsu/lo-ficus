# Welcome to loFicus
This app was created as a tool to help with two issues.
1. I struggle with time blindness and haven't been able to find a timer system that works for me. Generally if I set a timer in a browser tab - I'll quickly forget it's there or have no visibility into how much time I have left while I'm working in other tabs/windows. Having an audio cue when time is up helps, but I focus on tasks better with music playing - particularly loFi playlists. I need a tool that lets me configure timers with audio and experiment with the ways I can best tackle this problem.
2. I'm a hands on learner. I don't absorb information by reading docs or watching videos. If I try those methods I last less than 10 minutes before my brain takes a detour and starts solving a different problem. I have to re-watch or re-read the same section multiple times to even be able to take notes on what I'm learning. This is slow, horribly inefficient, and frankly quite boring. Even existing coding courses are difficult for me because I find it hard to troubleshoot or grasp everything that's happening when using pre-made starter code. I really need to create things from scratch and break them a million different ways in order to understand why the finished code works.

I focus best when I'm learning something in order to solve a problem I'm already motivated to solve. Building something that I need gives me both the focus and motivation to learn effectively.

This project was created with create-react-app, so I'm leaving a lot of the boilerplate stuff in the README for now in case I want to reference it later.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
